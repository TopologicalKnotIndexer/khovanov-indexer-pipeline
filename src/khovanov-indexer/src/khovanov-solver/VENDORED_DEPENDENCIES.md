# Vendored dependencies

This repository is self-contained. Former Git submodules are tracked as regular files at the audited commits below. Their original directory layout is preserved so runtime imports and entry points remain compatible.

## Updating a vendored dependency

Replace the listed tree from a reviewed source commit, update this table, and run this repository's complete validation suite. Do not reintroduce Git submodules; every organization project must remain independently cloneable.
